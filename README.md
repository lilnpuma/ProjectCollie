## Overview

The aim of the project is to implement a solution for automation of warehouses using manipulator robot to perform kitting operations autonomously. Robotic Kitting is the creation of product assortments, most often for retail sale. High speed picking robots are well adapted to this task. Using robot vision, autonomous
kitting robots identify individual products and assemble the assortment.

The robot system consists of a stationary overhead camera
and 7-DOF Panda Robotic Arm acting as the manipulator,
which can pick and place various objects as needed. The
objective of the system is to use color as a criteria for
kitting where each kit consists of a known assortment of
colored objects. Having identified the items to kit, the robot
picks the object up sequentially and moves them into their
respective bins. The primary application for color based kitting
is for candies and sweets kitted based on holidays, but this
application can be generalized further to allow implementation
in various industries to automated their assembly chain.
